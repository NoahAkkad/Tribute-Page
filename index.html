      <h3>Early life</h3>Al Akkad was born on July 1, 1930 in Aleppo in the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon.He
      received his
      high school degree from the Aleppo American College. His father, then a customs officer, gave him $200 and a copy
      of theQuran before he left for the United States to study film direction and production at the University of
      California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Akkad spent a further three years studying for a Master's degree at the University
      of Southern California (USC), where he met the director Sam Peckinpah. Peckinpah became Akkad's mentor in
      Hollywood and hired him as a consultant for a film about the Algerian War that never made it to the big screen,
      but he continued to encourage him until he found a job as a producer at CBS.

      <h3>Career</h3>In 1976, he produced and directed Mohammad, Messenger of God (released as The Message in 1977 in
      the
      United States), starring Anthony Quinn and Irene Papas. Akkad faced resistance from Hollywood, which forced him to
      make the film in Morocco. While creating Muhammad, Messenger of God, he consulted Islamic clerics, he wanted and
      tried to be respectful towards Islam and its views on portraying Muhammad. He got the Approval from Al-Azhar
      University in Egypt but was rejected by the Muslim World League in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The Governments of Kuwait,
      Libya and Morocco promised to support the film financially, and when it was rejected by the Muslim World League,
      Kuwait kept its financial support but stopped other kinds of supports. King Hassan II of Morocco gave his full
      support for the production of the film. The production took one year, Akkad filmed for 6 months in Morocco, but
      had to stop when the Saudi Government exerted great pressure on the government of Morocco to stop the production.
      Akkad went to Muammar Gaddafi of Libya for support in order to complete the project, Gaddafi allowed him to move
      the filming to Libya for the remaining 6 months until the film was finalized. Akkad saw the film as a way to
      bridge the gap between the Western and Muslim worlds, stating in a 1976 interview: I did the film because it is a
      personal thing for me. Besides its production values as a film, it has its story, its intrigue, its drama. Besides
      all this I think there was something personal, being a Muslim myself who lived in the west I felt that it was my
      obligation my duty to tell the truth about Islam. It is a religion that has a 700 million following, yet it's so
      little known about which surprised me. I thought I should tell the story that will bring this bridge, this gap to
      the west. In 1978, he helped make low-budget film history when he produced Halloween. Akkad became best known for
      his key involvement in the first eight Halloween movies, as an executive producer (the only producer to
      participate in all of these films). The series was highly profitable. In 1980 he directed Lion of the Desert, in
      which Quinn and Irene Papas were joined by Oliver Reed, Rod Steiger,and John Gielgud. It was about the real-life
      Bedouin leader Omar Mukhtar (Quinn), who fought Benito Mussolini's Italian troops in the deserts of Libya. The
      movie is now critically acclaimed, after initially receiving negative publicity in the West for being partially
      funded by Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, who invested $35 million in the movie. This negative publicity may have been
      the cause of its relatively poor performance at the box office. Clint Morris describes the movie as: "A grand epic
      adventure that'll stand as a highpoint in the producing career of Moustapha Akkad."[4] In 1985, his production
      company Trancas International Films had inked an agreement with Galaxy International releasing in order to release
      films for a seven-picture agreement worldwide. In the United Kingdom, Akkad once tried to buy Pinewood Studios
      from The Rank Organisation and also had a studio at Twickenham. At the time of his death, he was in the process of
      producing an $80 million movie featuring Sean Connery about Saladin and the Crusades, for which he already had the
      script, that would be filmed in Jordan. Speaking of the film, he said: Saladin exactly portrays Islam. Right now,
      Islam is portrayed as a terrorist religion. Because a few terrorists are Muslims, the whole religion has that
      image. If there ever was a religious war full of terror, it was the Crusades. But you can't blame Christianity
      because a few adventurers did this. That's my message.</artical>
